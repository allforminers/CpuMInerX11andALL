cpuminer-opt is a command line program. Windows users should be familiar with using the
command prompt or Powershell. Simple BAT files can be created or a cpuminer config file
can be used to simplify usage. There are many tutorial and examples available on the web.

Users should also be familiar with their CPU's architecture and features to ensure they get the best
performance.

Windows binary files are named for the specific CPU architecture they were compiled for.
See README.txt for details.

Linux users must compile from source, see Compiling Wiki page.

cpuminer-opt uses standard unix command line syntax and CLI options similar to ccminer and other forks of cpuminer. See CLI options Wiki page for a detailed description of important options.

CPU mining puts a lot of stress on a CPU and generates a lot of heat. Monitor CPU temerature and ensure
adequate cooling. Mining with any device with a battery (laptop) or tiny PCs with poor airflow is not
recommended. Ensure adequate cooling and monitor CPU temperatures.
